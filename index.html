            Born in Texas, grew up in Winston-Salem, NC. I graduated from
            Samford University in 2012 after which I've worked business-analyst
            roles and really enjoyed what I've learned. In every job I've had,
            I've found myself ending up spending well over 50% of my time
            building spreadsheets - it's the way I've been able to create the
            most value regardless of my role, and it's what I've enjoyed the
            most. In September, I decided to try to take the next step in my
            enjoyment of designing and building tools / organizing data, by
            doing a web-development bootcamp. I've really enjoyed everything
            I've been learning, and want to code for the rest of my life.

            I really enjoy reading articles on the web about a lot of topics.
            Above is my user page from a site a friend of mine made as he taught
            himself to code via Udemy. It's intended to allow users to track
            what they've been reading so they can reflect back on what they've
            been learning, and so the users can see what each other read. It's
            called "Breads" as a play on the words "B"undy (my friend Austin's
            last name) + "reads" We talked through the concept a lot and I've
            learned a ton just discussing the site/app with him as he's built it
            throughout this year.

    I also love keyboard shortcuts. Here are some of my favorites from
    Microsoft:
  </p>
  <span>CTRL arrows</span>
  <span>Alt Tab</span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <p class="text-justify text-light">
    I've really enjoyed using VS Code as an IDE, because a lot of my
    keyboard shortcuts transfer well. Here are some of my favorite VS
    Code extensions:
  </p>
  <span>Bracket Colorizer -- add link</span>
  <span>Helium Icons -- add link</span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <p>
    Some of the VS Code keyboard shortcuts I've been using that've been
    helpful:
  </p>
  <span>Alt + arrow keys to move lines of code up and down</span>
  <span></span>
